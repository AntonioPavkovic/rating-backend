### Emotion 

*This table holds information about available emotion(emoji), by default 
it has 5 rows, each row has emotion id, name and color.*

---
### Setting

*This table holds information about current setting, it has only one row 
with 3 columns, number of emotions(emojis) which is set to user view,
message that will pop after user rates some service and message delay column,
which holds information for how long should message stay on screen before it 
resets to a previous screen.
There are some validation rules applied to these columns:*

### Rating

*This table holds information about all ratings applied.It stores data about 
when the rating is applied(createdAt) and which emotion is applied(emotionId).
This table is connected to rating table with **Many-To-One** relationship.*

---
### Emotion-Setting

*This table holds information about order in which the emotions will be presented
on the user-view depending on which setting(number of emotion) is set.
This table is connected on emotion with **Many-To-One** relationship.*

---
### Custom-User

*This table will hold information about our users which have access to some endpoints
that are protected with OAuth2 protocol*.

---
### Available endpoints

**Public:**

- GET "http://localhost:9000/api/v1/settings" (returns current settings and list of emojis)
- POST "http://localhost:9000/api/v1/ratings" (creates rating based on emotionId)

**Protected:**
- PATCH "http://localhost:9000/api/v1/settings" (updates setting table)
- GET "http://localhost:9000/api/v1/ratings" (returns a list of ratings for passed range arguments)

---

### Authorization

*For authorization, we used OAuth2 protocol(Implicit flow because our frontend is Single page app).
To be able to access our protected endpoints you should provide Bearer token
in header of every request(because Session Management is set to **Stateless**)*

---

### Pusher

*In our project, we also used Pusher, JSON based protocol used by clients to communicate with Pusher Channels,
mainly over a ***WebSocket*** connection.With pusher, we managed to send information
trough channel when table setting gets updated so the front side can gather information
and apply changes without page refresh.*

---

### Slack

*We also used ***Slack api*** for sending messages to Slack channel once per a day 
if number of daily ratings is lower than expected.*
